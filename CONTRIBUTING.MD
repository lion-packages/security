# Contributing to Lion-Packages Open-Source PHP Projects

Thank you for considering contributing to our open-source projects! We strive to maintain a collaborative and welcoming environment for all contributors. Before submitting your contribution, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Mutual Respect**: Treat all community members with respect. We do not tolerate harassment or offensive behavior.

2. **Adherence to PSR Standards**: Our PHP projects follow the standards defined by [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/). Please ensure that your code complies with the relevant PSR standards.

3. **Adherence to Lion-Packages Standards**: Our PHP projects also follow our own standards along with the PSR, lease [Lion-Packages Standards](https://lion-packages.vercel.app/standards).

3. **Creating an Issue**: Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, please open an issue to discuss it. This helps ensure that your contribution aligns with the project's goals and avoids duplication of effort.

4. **Branching Strategy**: When contributing code, create a new branch off the `main` branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch that summarizes the changes you are making.

5. **Pull Request Process**: When submitting a pull request, provide a clear and concise description of the changes you've made. Ensure that your code passes all tests and linting checks. If your pull request addresses an open issue, reference the issue number in the description.

6. **Code Reviews**: All pull requests require review before merging. Be open to feedback and be willing to make changes based on reviewer suggestions.

7. **Documentation**: If your contribution introduces new features or changes existing functionality, update the project's documentation accordingly.

8. **Licensing**: By contributing to our projects, you agree to license your code under the same license as the project (typically [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)). Ensure that any new files include the appropriate license header.
